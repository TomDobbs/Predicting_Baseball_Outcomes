GOAL:
I want to predict baseball game outcomes.

WHY:
I chose this topic for a number of reasons...
1. I love baseball and they have a LOT of data for a sport
2. The type of data being logged is very new
3. Data munging will be very important & will be a complex challenge for me
4. If my model is good enough, betting on baseball games could become a side hobby ;)

TARGET:
Win or Lose

FEATURES:
- Pitcher (Pitch repoirtoire)(Bucket types of pitchers)
- Batters (Lineup)(Bucket types of batters)

DATA: 
Daily baseball data and historical data exists going back to 2008, PitchFX data is the most common place to retrieve data from. Will require scraping the information.
