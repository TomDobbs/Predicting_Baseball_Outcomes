### With MLB statistics I used Logitstic Regression to predict the Winner of baseball games using starting lineups, starting pitchers, & team stats as inputs.

### Final Model accurately predicted the Winning Team 56.5% of the time.

###### - All Data Scraped from MLB website ranging from *2007-2015* baseball seasons.
